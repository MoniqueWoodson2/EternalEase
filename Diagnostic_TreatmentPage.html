        <h2>How Is Mental Illness Diagnosed?</h2>
        <p><strong>Mental illness</strong> is typically diagnosed by a mental health professional using the <strong>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)</strong> criteria. The process may involve:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Primary Care Evaluation:</strong> Initial assessment by a primary care physician, who may refer the individual to a mental health specialist.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Evaluation:</strong> Rule out underlying physical causes by conducting medical tests (e.g., bloodwork) to eliminate conditions that might contribute to mental health symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychological Evaluation:</strong> Conducted by a psychiatrist or psychologist, involving discussions about symptoms, family history, and the use of psychological evaluation tools like questionnaires.</li>
            <li><strong>DSM-5 Criteria:</strong> Assessment based on criteria outlined in the DSM-5 to determine if the individual meets the criteria for a specific mental illness.</li>

            <li><strong>Self-Help and Support Groups:</strong> Engaging in self-help techniques and participating in support groups can provide additional support.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Adopting a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, balanced nutrition, sufficient sleep, and stress management can contribute to overall well-being.</li>
