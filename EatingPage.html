        <h2>Overview of Eating Disorders:</h2>
        <p1><strong>An eating disorder</strong> is characterized by compulsive and unhealthy eating behaviors, often accompanied by a preoccupation with body image, and can result in severe medical consequences.

        <h3>Types of Eating Disorders:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anorexia Nervosa:</strong> Involves an intense fear of gaining weight, leading to self-starvation and potential health risks such as decreased bone density.</li>
            <li><strong>Bulimia Nervosa:</strong> Individuals with bulimia nervosa engage in binge-eating followed by purging behaviors, such as vomiting, excessive exercise, or laxative use.</li>
            <li><strong>Binge Eating Disorder:</strong> Characterized by consuming large amounts of food in a short time, often accompanied by feelings of lack of control and shame. Unlike bulimia, there is no purging after a binge.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID):</strong> Involves a fear of eating certain foods, leading to nutritional deficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Pica:</strong> People with pica regularly consume non-food objects like chalk, coins, pebbles, or paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Rumination Disorder:</strong> Involves the unintentional regurgitation of food, re-chewing, and re-swallowing.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED):</strong> Encompasses any eating disorder causing distress and impairing daily functioning, not fitting into specific diagnostic categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding the different types of eating disorders is crucial for early identification, intervention, and appropriate treatment to address both the mental and physical aspects of these conditions.</p>
