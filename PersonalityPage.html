        <h3>Common symptoms of Personality Disorders include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strange or unpredictable behavior.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Suspicion and distrust (not trusting others).</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Taking risks.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Extreme mood swings or emotional outbursts.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty with relationships.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Problems at school or work.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Need for instant gratification (immediate pleasure or reward).</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Many people have some of these traits, but they do not fit a diagnosis of personality disorder. Personality disorders tend to start in adolescence (teenage years). The thoughts and behaviors become more firmly fixed in adulthood. People with personality disorders might not be aware that they have a problem. They may find it hard to seek help. Family or friends may be severely affected by caring for someone with a personality disorder and they may be the ones to seek help.</strong></p>
