Eating disorders involve disruptions in eating habits, weight regulation, and body image perceptions that significantly impact physical and mental health. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, is crucial for addressing the underlying issues and developing a healthy relationship with food and body image. Eating disorders are serious mental health conditions that require proper diagnosis and treatment to promote long-term well-being. <strong>Remember, this questionnaire is not a diagnostic tool but serves as a starting point for understanding your mental health. If you have urgent concerns or are in crisis, please reach out to a mental health professional or a helpline in your area. Your well-being is important, and seeking support is a brave and positive step toward mental health.</strong> </p>';
